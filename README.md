This project is about obtaining feature importance in a very simple and relatively fast way.
Given a dataset, we aim to find the importance of the features(regressors/ covariates/ independent variables) for a given response(dependent variable/ label/ target).

This only works if the variables are characters, factors, integers or numerics in general.
